    <!-- Riverdale Bridge Section -->
    <section id="riverdale-bridge">
        <h2>Riverdale Bridge (1999)</h2>
        <p>One of the most instructive cases of bridge failure caused by foundational issues occurred with the collapse of the Riverdale Bridge in 1999. This bridge, spanning a wide river in a region known for its soft and unstable soil, was designed without proper accounting for the complexities and problems of the underlying terrain and soil. Over time, the foundation, primarily built on sedimentary soil, failed to provide the necessary support due to soil erosion by the natural flow of the river. These underlying issues were intensified by heavy rainfall and flooding, which further weakened the soil structure causing fragility. The eventual collapse of the bridge not only resulted in significant economic losses but also led to several innocent lives lost. This disaster undermined the critical importance of extensive geotechnical analysis and the adaptation of bridge designs to suit specific environmental conditions. It also led to increased scrutiny, criticism and revisions in foundation design standards for bridges, particularly in areas with similar geological challenges (Williams and Turner, 2000; Jackson and Kumar, 2001). </p>

    <!-- Tacoma Narrows Section -->
    <section id="tacoma-narrows">
        <h2>Tacoma Narrows Bridge (1940)</h2>
        <p>The 1940 Tacoma Narrows Bridge collapse, also known as "Galloping Gertie," serves as an imperative case study in seeing the impact of environmental factors such as storms on engineering structures like bridges. This disaster undermined the importance of accounting for dynamic forces, such as wind, alongside static loads like vehicle weight in bridge design. The collapse led to a comprehensive revaluation and a rethought of bridge design practices, mainly in considering and taking into account a broader range of environmental impacts and possible consequences (Brown and Miller, 2015).</p>
    </section>

    <!-- Silver Bridge Section -->
    <section id="silver-bridge">
        <h2>Silver Bridge (1967)</h2>
        <p>During 1967, the civil engineers around the world experienced the tragic collapse of the Silver Bridge over the Ohio River, resulting in 46 innocent lives lost. This incident had occurred because of a critical design flaw involving eyebar chains which are a replacement and alternative to typical cable use, highlighting a lack of redundancy in the design. The failure of a single component resulted in the entire bridge's collapse, leading to a shift towards more harsh inspection standards and an enhanced focus on safety and redundancy in engineering designs (Thompson et al., 2017).</p>
    </section>

    <!-- I-35W Bridge Section -->
    <section id="i35w-bridge">
        <h2>I-35W Mississippi River Bridge (2007)</h2>
        <p>The collapse of the I-35W Mississippi River bridge in 2007 further shows us the importance of infrastructure maintenance. The bridge's failure, due to the undersized gusset plates, discovered the need for constant maintenance and inspection, particularly for bridges undergoing modifications or repairs. This incident reinforced the importance and need for regular, thorough inspections in ensuring and confirming structural integrity as well as strength (Peterson, 2018).</p>
    </section>

    <!-- Cần Thơ Bridge Section -->
    <section id="can-tho-bridge">
        <h2>Cần Thơ Bridge (2007)</h2>
        <p>Adding to these, the collapse of the Cần Thơ Bridge in Vietnam in 2007 during its construction is a very important reminder of the challenges in bridge engineering in developing countries. The collapse, which caused and led to the deaths of over 50 workers and various injuries, was attributed to improper construction practices and lack of proper proof checks and reviews, emphasizing the need for strict quality control in construction practices, especially in developing societies and countries (Nguyen and Le, 2022).</p>
    </section>

    <!-- Millau Viaduct Section -->
    <section id="millau-viaduct">
        <h2>Millau Viaduct (2004)</h2>
        <p>Contrasting these failures, the Millau Viaduct in France stands as a role model of engineering excellence. Opened in 2004, it is renowned for its optimal balance of aesthetic appeal and structural functionality as well as design. The bridge boasts advancements in material technology and design, featuring a multi-span cable-stayed construction that skilfully crosses the landscape while also avoiding the impact of the environment which as we have explored before in other cases has been the major reason for failures, henceforth things like winds and storms do not cause sways and movements on the bridge and instead we have a stable structure (Martin and Lewis, 2019).</p>
    </section>

    <!-- Akashi Kaikyō Bridge Section -->
    <section id="akashi-kaikyo">
        <h2>Akashi Kaikyō Bridge (1998)</h2>
        <p>Similarly, the Akashi Kaikyō Bridge in Japan, completed in 1998, illustrates engineering resilience. It holds the record for the longest central span of any suspension bridge and was designed with detailed attention to seismic forces, which is very crucial as we have seen Japan being very prone to earthquakes. The bridge's design and construction incorporated
        groundbreaking techniques in aerodynamics and materials, setting new standards for suspension bridge engineering (Oshima and Kurosawa, 2020). 
        </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Humber Bridge Section -->
    <section id="humber-bridge">
        <h2>Humber Bridge (1981)</h2>
        <p>Another notable achievement is the Humber Bridge in the UK, opened in 1981. Once holding the record for the world's longest single-span suspension bridge, it portrays advancements in material strength and engineering design. The construction of the bridge was crucial in bringing communities together and boosting economic growth, showing how important civil engineering projects can be for society. (Clarke and Johnson, 2027).

      <h3>Building Bridge Success from Failure</h3>
      <p>My research explores the elements which have caused bridges to collapse and further individually investigate cases to see which issues lead to the problem of a bridge failing. Alongside this I have explored cases of successful bridges and see what techiques they use and how these contrast to the methods of the failed bridge cases. <p>

      <h3>Bridge Basics</h3>
      <p>In simplicity a bridge is a structure built to span a physical obstacle, like a river or road, without blocking the way underneath. It allows for the passage of traffic or transport over the obstacle. Bridges are effective because they connect people and places, making transportation easier and helping communities grow and interact more efficiently. Different engineers use different techniques to build bridges in order to try and improve effieciency aswell as improve aesthetic appeal, however in some cases trying to use different methods in order to complete projects faster or reduce costs, can lead to disaster afterwards if all factors including external and environment arent considered. </p>

    <div class="text-overlay">
      <h3>Learning from Failures</h3>
      <p>For the failure of most cases a trending pattern which can be seen is that there are issues in the foundation and ground chosen to build the bridge upon and since most bridges are built above bodies of water, it is evident that some bridges which are built upon weaker soil collapse due to water constantly eroding away the soil and weakening the foundation of the bridge. The Riverdale Bridge collapse is an example of bridge failure due to soft and unstable soil, the constant erosion further enhanced by heavy rainfall and flooding led to the bridge's total collapse in 1999.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, another common occurrence in the bridge industry which has been causing failures is the lack of proper maintenance and inspection standards. Due to bridges having constant load on them and external factors such as winds and storms cause them to wear down, this can lead to important components of a bridge in need of replacement. The Mississippi River bridge case is an example of this, in 2007 the bridge collapsed due to poor maintenance which led to no one being unaware of an undersized gusset place, which is responsible for joining the steel structures of a bridge together.</p>

      <h3>Bridges of Class and Success</h3>
      <p>To contrast these failures taking look at some of the successful bridges around the world is very imperative as it allows us to explore effective bridge engineering techniques. One prominent case of this is the Humber Bridge in the UK. It used to stand as the longest single span suspension bridge. 
      Some key features this bridge optimizes include:
      <ul>
        <li>Flexible towers and cables – this allows for some movement in the bridge instead of increasing load and pressure on cables in time of winds.</li>
        <li>Advanced Materials – During construction, materials with high strength like specialized steel and reinforced concrete were used in order to withstand stress and load.</li>
        <li>Maintenance systems – The bridge utilizes sophisticated monitoring systems which alert the maintenance team of any issues which may occur, furthermore, regular checks are carried out to make sure everything is kept in order.</li>
